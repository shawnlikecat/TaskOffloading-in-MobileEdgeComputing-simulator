This project has made the following contributions,
1. In order to reduce the delay and energy consumption of repeated task offloading and processing, a caching mechanism is introduced. The mechanism considers task request probability, task access time, task average request time, freshness and data size to decide which tasks to cache. By considering these factors, the caching mechanism can effectively optimize the selection of tasks for caching.
2. In order to further improve the performance and accuracy of the caching mechanism, a cache update strategy is proposed based on the above caching mechanism. Evaluate the effectiveness of this strategy by monitoring cache utilization and cache hit ratios over time.
3. This paper mainly studies the joint optimization model of task offloading and caching in a multi-user single MEC environment, with the goal of minimizing the total task delay and total energy consumption. The optimization problem of this model is a mixed integer nonlinear programming problem (MINLP). To solve this optimization problem, the total delay and energy consumption are defined as objective functions, and a penalty function is used to deal with the constraints. Transform the optimization problem into a fitness function, and use the particle swarm optimization algorithm to obtain the optimal joint decision.
